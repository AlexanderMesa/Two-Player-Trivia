We created a multiplayer trivia game allowing two people to play against each other from separate devices.
We used Axios to make our API calls and it supplied us with  the random questions for our game. We then used socket
IO to handle our multi player functions, updates of user inputs, and to keeps track of the games connections.

## Technologies/Tools Used 

* Node 
* Express 
* Handlebars 
* MySQL 
* Sequelize 
* Socket IO 
* Heroku
* Axios
* Sockets
* Bootstrap

## Stretch Goals

* Live chat between gamers 
* Difficulty level selection 
* The ability to add a 3rd and 4th player 
* Category selection for each question 
* Sound Timer for each question
